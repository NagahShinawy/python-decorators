# you can pass function as input to another function

# using function within function, is the basic of decorators


=======================================
Decorators run before function it is decorating is called?

I believe python decorators are just syntactic sugar.

@foo
def bar ():
    pass
is the same thing as

def bar ():
    pass
bar = foo(bar)

As you can see, foo is being called even though bar has not been called.
This is why you see the output from your decorator function.
Your output should contain a single line for every function you applied your decorator to.

============================

def upper(function):
    print("testing", function)

    def wrapper():
        text = function()
        return text.upper()

    return wrapper


def username():
    return "john"



#1 if you use decorator using '@' it converts to something line above and python runs line like below
# WITHOUT RUNS FROM YOU. IT RUNS AUTOMATICALLY

upper_name = upper(username)  # testing <function username at 0x0000022A2991CEE8>

#2 next step from you to actually run function
upper_name  # <function upper.<locals>.wrapper at 0x0000022A2991CF78>
upper_name()   # JOHN

===============================================

@to_bold_tag
@to_italic_tag
def get_user_name():
    """
    user name
    :return:
    """
    return "Smith"


- function docs comes from last decorator written so, in this case from bold
- to update use @wraps(func)
